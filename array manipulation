def arrayManipulation(n, queries):
    array = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for query in queries: 
        a = query[0] - 1
        b = query[1]
        k = query[2]
        array[a] += k
        array[b] -= k
        print(array)
    
    max = 0
    sum = 0
    for ele in array:
        sum += ele
        if sum > max:
            max = sum
    return max


## Logic - 
1. Brute force approach - successful by runtime error since constraints are very huge
2. Pre Sum Approach
* Make the array (n + 1) since we use zero based indexing
* instead of updating all elements, update only the start and the next position after the end
* start_pos += k and end_pos -= k ---> this subtraction makes sure when you take a running sum, you donot shoot beyond the end value, so -k reverses the effect
* running sum and then take the max :)

## Solid Example

5 3
1 2 100
2 5 100
3 4 100

[0    0    0   0  0  0] #length 6 
[100, 0, -100, 0, 0, 0] 
[100, 100, -100, 0, 0, -100]
[100, 100, 0, 0, -100, -100]
